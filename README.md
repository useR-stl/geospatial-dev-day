# Geospatial Dev Day at useR! 2020

## Event Details

Prior to the main conference, [useR! 2020](https://user2020.r-project.org/) will feature a dedicated developer day with a focus on open source spatial R software as a part of the conference's Geospatial Track. Space will be provided on the Monday before the conference for those in the R community to work together in person on spatial packages. The event will be hosted at Geosaurus Rex, St. Louisâ€™ premier geospatial innovation incubator.

- **Location:** Geosaurus, [T-REX](http://www.downtowntrex.org/), 911 Washington Ave Suite 500, St. Louis, MO 63101
- **Date**: Monday, July 6, 2020, 9am-5pm

Attendees will need to indicate at registration whether they are interested in participating in this event. There will be a nominal cost to participants so that we can provide lunch.

## Participating in Geospatial Dev Day

Details for the event are still being worked out. Please join the conversation in this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/useR-stl/geospatial-dev-day/issues)!

We'd like your input on:

- How to incorporate remote participation
- How to structure pair programming
- What types of work you'd like to get done
- How to indicate that something is suitable for contribution

We also are looking for spatial R package authors to **tag and identify discrete issues** that can be worked on during the event, as well as to support with merging/providing feedback on contributions as needed. More details about how to do so will be included shortly. 

## Questions?

This event is being coordinated by the useR! 2020 Geospatial Track team, led by Angela Li. Please reach out to useR2020@slu.edu with questions.

P.S. Thanks to Tim Salabim and Edzer Pebesma for [starting the conversation](https://github.com/r-spatial/discuss/issues/26) in the r-spatial organization!
